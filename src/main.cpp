 * This is the main file for my least cost finding algorithm.
 *
 * If anything looks at all unprofessional, it's because it is. I was only able to scrape
 * this together by teaching myself both Raylib and one of the fundamentals of Dynamic
 * Programming through ChatGPT. Over the course of a week. In pajama shorts.
 *
 * The following code IS NOT AI-GENERATED... but it's far from sophisticated enough that
 * an AI couldn't just spit back out roughly the same thing. This program was a learning
 * experience above all else.
 *
 * This is on my GitHub, so because it's freely available, it's freely usable. If Elon Musk
 * wants to use my crappy program for something, by all means, he has the right. So do you.
